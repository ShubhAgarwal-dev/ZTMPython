Hello I Shubh Agarwal, nice to meet you.
HMS Hood (51 bird number) was the blood of the Royal Navy (RN).
Hood first planned four admiral fighting classes to be built during World War I
When construction took place at the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916, that battle revealed the most serious flaws in its design, though the most formidable improvements were made before four of them were completed. years after. For this reason the only ship of his fleet was to be completed, so that the Admiralty thought it would be better to begin with the world's strategy in the ensuing battles, for the G-3 fleet was never built. Despite the appearance of modern and modern ships, the Hood remained the largest warship in the world twenty years after its commission, and its influence on the nickname "The Rock Hood" shone.
